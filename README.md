## Pizza or Pasta Recognition

The purpose of the project are to recognize an image using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in real-time using web browser. 

Library like bing-image-downloader are helping me to gather all the images of pizza and pasta, 
from the dataset i build an architecture of 5 layer of Convolution layers and achieved of 86% training and 82% of validation. 

Using Flask i could finalize my project to recognize the image in real-time in web browser as a back-end server to process the image.
